\section{Introduction}
Recent works have called into question the exact topological nature of \ac{FTS} claiming the crystal is not a topological insulator but rather a topological semi-metal with buried Dirac nodes\cite{Borisenko2020}. In light of this it is crucial to obtain evidence with more experimental techniques to better understand the nature of the topology in the \ac{FTS} system. Indeed, the underlying physics which predicts the helical hinge mode also predicts the same mode to manifest as a bias-independent conductance plateau in a differential conductance measurement rather than the previously observed zero-bias conductance peak\cite{DasSarma2018, Gray2019}. To accomplish this, we investigate the effect edge quality has on the topological characteristics of \ac{FTS} as it has been previously shown that the quality of the crystal edge can have a drastic effect on its transport characteristics \cite{Young2014}. We find that when tunneling measurements are performed across pristine, high-symmetry crystalline edges bias-independent conductance plateaus consistent with \acl{PAR} are consistently observed below bias voltages of 6 meV. When performing the same experiment across ``rough" edges such plateaus are not observed. Given how rare it is to observe \ac{PAR}, usually it is due to an underlying mechanism such as symmetry-forbidden backscattering.\cite{Lee2019} 

\section{Observation of Bias-Independent Conductance Plateau}

The tunneling conductance of a normal-metal/superconductor interface can be modeled by assuming an delta-function potential barrier at the interface characterized by a strength parameter $Z$, i.e., the \ac{BTK} model. An in-depth discussion and pseudo code for performing these simulations can be found in Appendix \ref{app:ARfit}], however we will take some of the main results of these calculations for discussions here. The \ac{BTK} model on a standard \ac{BCS} s-wave superconductor predicts a bias-independent conductance plateau only when the strength of the potential barrier between the normal-metal and superconductor is exactly zero and only at temperatures lower than $0.2T_{c}$. Even slight deviations from a zero-strength barrier results in significant dips around zero-bias, thus observing \ac{PAR} is exceedingly rare and typically only occurs only in extremely clean materials \cite{Lee2019, Soulen85}. Therefore when \ac{PAR} is observed in a system it is usually due to an underlying mechanism which causes the incoming carriers to ignore the barrier completely, such as forbidden backscattering due to topological spin-momentum locked bands\cite{Lee2019,Young2009}. \ac{PAR} has three unique identifiers in a differential conductance spectrum: a perfectly flat plateau, the plateau is at twice the conductance of the normal state, and the plateau extends out to the superconducting energy gap.\par

	\label{fig:StraightVsNormal}
\end{figure}
To study the effect of edge quality on the differential conductance, we fabricated contacts on flakes which has long straight edges (Fig \ref{fig:PARDeviceFab}a). Using TEM, these edges were shown to be high-symmetry [100] faces indicating a pristine crystal edge (Fig \ref{fig:PARDeviceFab} b). Strikingly, these pristine crystal edges showed a bias-independent conductance plateau at low bias energies. These plateaus are perfectly flat and are exactly twice the normal-state conductance (measured using the conductance values at high-bias). When using a current bias, the plateaus extend out to about 1 meV, with additional peaks around 2 meV which is similar to the superconducting gaps measured by \ac{STM} and \ac{ARPES} which observe multiple gaps typically around 1.7 meV, 2.5 meV, and 3 meV\cite{Zhang2018, Zhu2020}. Both the outer peaks and the plateau shoulders follow a \ac{BCS} temperature dependence and both quench at $T_{c}$, as measured by the sudden drop in resistance seen in Fig \ref{fig:PARTemp}a. Furthermore, this plateau saturates at $2G_{n}$ as the temperature drops which indicates that this effect is not due to Joule heating due to poor contacts.\par

	\label{fig:ControlDevice}
\end{figure}
This bias-independent conductance plateau is observed in multiple devices with straight edges, however when performing tunneling experiments on ``rough" edges (i.e. edges that are not straight) the differential conductance does not show a plateau at low-biases (Fig \ref{fig:StraightVsNormal}). This pattern follows even when measuring different edges on the same flake as seen in Fig \ref{fig:ControlDevice}. In this device, the contact fabricated on the straight edge (highlighted in green) demonstrated a plateau below 6 meV of bias voltage. In contrast, the two contacts fabricated on the rough edges of the same flake both show spectra that are consistent with \ac{AR} but with a non-zero barrier strength. This suggests that either the \ac{PAR} in this system is sensitive to the local contact conditions or the contact to the bulk superconductivity is greatly increased with rough contacts. In the first case, the topological nature of \ac{FTS} would be immediately called into question as the topology should not be affected by local crystal symmetry breaking. Indeed, this would seem to indicate that \ac{FTS} would be something closer to a Topological Crystalline Insulator. In the latter case, the \ac{PAR} is not affected by the local contact conditions but the signal is drowned out among a much larger supercurrent when better contact is made to the superconducting bulk. This better contact might be attributed to multiple contacts points being made by the Cr/Au on the rough edges.\par

\end{figure}
While the temperature dependence of the width of this \ac{PAR} follows the \ac{BCS} model quite well, there is a striking difference when comparing the conductance at zero-bias to the \ac{BTK} model. Indeed, while a \ac{BTK} calculation with $Z=0$ displays a zero-bias conductance saturating around $T=0.2T_{c}$ the measured zero-bias conductance in \ac{FTS} saturates at a far higher temperature around $T = 0.75T_{c}$. This provides further evidence that the \ac{PAR} is not simply caused by lucky, perfect contacts as it seems the mechanism is only limited by the magnitude of the superconducting gap not by temperature.  

\section{Magnetic Field Dependence}
The Dirac surfaces states that are a key signature of a topological bulk are protected via time-reversal symmetry. It follows that if time-reversal symmetry is lifted via a magnetic field, any Dirac nodes that are aligned (the plane perpendicular to the spin-momentum locking determines the ``direction" of the cone) along the magnetic field will lose their time-reversal symmetry protection. In contrast, if the Dirac node is perpendicular to the magnetic field, the node will simply shift up or down in energy but the node will keep its topological protection. In this manner, if the \ac{PAR} is caused by forbidden backscattering due to topological bands we expect highly anisotropic responses to different directions of applied magnetic field. While this seems to be the case in \ac{FTS} (shown in Fig \ref{fig:PARField}) we must be careful to differentiate the response of the \ac{PAR} from that of the bulk superconductor. Even though the upper critical field of \ac{FTS} is around $35 T$\cite{Mele2012} the bulk superconducting response of \ac{FTS} flakes is quite anisotropic, even below $9 T$ \cite{zalic2019}. When applying a magnetic field parallel with the hinge being measured (the a-axis of the material), the \ac{PAR} remains completely unaffected up to $5 T$. Furthermore, when the field is rotated to the c-axis of the crystal the \ac{PAR} seems to collapse quite rapidly which would give credence to a topological origin as discussed earlier. However, similar to the temperature dependence, this apparent quenching of the \ac{PAR} can also be attributed to the bulk superconducting gap closing more quickly when the magnetic field is parallel to the c-axis of the crystal\cite{zalic2019}. Additionally, magnetic fields cause screening currents close to the surface of the superconductor giving rise to the Doppler effect wherein incoming carriers must match the increased momentum of the superfluid\cite{Zareapour2012}. Therefore, more work must be done in order to attribute the magnetic field response to an underlying topological origin.

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we extended the scope of our electronic spectroscopy of \ac{FTS} to uncover exciting underlying physics. Specifically, we used cleaner crystals and lower temperatures to observe \acl{PAR} in \ac{FTS} indicating an underlying topological mechanism that allows tunneling carriers to ignore the potential barrier. Interestingly, the \ac{PAR} only manifests along clean, straight edges not along ``rough" edges indicating that this mechanism is either very sensitive to local conditions or its signal drowned out due to better contact to the superconducting bulk. To further investigate if this mechanism is topological in nature, we explored the response of the \ac{PAR} to external magnetic fields parallel to the $a$ and $c$-axis. We found that while the \ac{PAR} is quenched far quicker in a c-axis magnetic field than an a-axis magnetic field, it is not out of reach to attribute this to the bulk superconducting gap becoming quite small in a c-axis field, rather than the magnetic field affecting the \ac{PAR}-causing mechanism directly. Further measurements still need to be done to determine if a b-axis field affects the \ac{PAR} differently from an a-axis field. If it does, then we may be able to use the superconducting Doppler effect to determine where the tunnel junction is and if it is due to a 1D mode along the hinge or a 2D surface along the side of the material.
