\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {1.1}{\ignorespaces Dispersion relations of a 1D p-wave superconductor plotted at three different $\mu $ values. a) The trivial p-wave pairing scenario. The individual majorana particles each couple to the majorana on the same site. b) The critical value for $\mu $ where the gap closes. c) The topological p-wave pairing scenario. The majorana particles pair with majoranas on the nearest-neighbor site instead of on the same site. Two majorana zero modes are left on the edges of the wire, consistent with the bulk-boundary correspondence.}}{5}{figure.1.1}%

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.1}{\ignorespaces 1a) Picture of the Cleanroom-in-a-Glovebox. b) Raman spectra measured on $\alpha $RuCl$_{3}$ showing the difference exfoliation in the inert atmosphere makes. Raman measurements were taken using the WITec Raman System installed in the glovebox. c) Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\delta }$ exfoliated onto a thin film of Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_{x}$As. The film was then etched into a double hall-bar structure around the flake. d) Photo of the UHV suitcase during a device transfer from the glovebox to the low-temperature Raman system. The UHV suitcase is attached to the back of the glovebox.}}{10}{figure.2.1}%

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.2}{\ignorespaces a) Line scan using the \textit {in-situ} AFM on a halfnium oxide and mica substrate. This data demonstrates both the effectiveness of our vibration isolation methods and the atomically flat surface of mica. b) Area scan of a patterned CVD graphene device using the \textit {in-situ} Raman system. Graphene is outlined in green while color represents the intensity of the 2D-peak. c) Photoluminescence of MoS$_{2}$ exfoliated on mica. Blue data represents MoS$_{2}$ which was exfoliated onto mica in the glovebox while green represents exfoliation in the ambient environment. The inset shows Raman spectroscopy in the same conditions as the PL. We note that since the phonon modes do not shift in energy we can attribute this drastic change in PL to the inert glovebox environment and not to the dielectric characteristics of the substrate.}}{13}{figure.2.2}%

Even at 7 K, the sample shows quantum oscillations (see arrows). d) Superconducting aluminum loops of 1 $\mu $m radius fabricated onto FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$ demonstrating the single micron resolution of the $\mu $PG101 photolithography system. e) Periodic arrays of 1 $\mu $m gold pillars.}}{16}{figure.2.3}%

The black line is a fit to McMillan-Rowell Oscillations which follow the equation, $\Delta V = n\times \frac {hv_{F}}{4ed_{s}}$.

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.3}{\ignorespaces a) dI/dV versus voltage normalized to the spectra taken at T$_{c}$ (solid line) with a Lorentzian fit (dashed line), for $T=7K$, $9K$, and $15K$. b) and c) ZBCP heights and widths, respectively, extracted from the Lorentzian fit versus temperature. The exponential temperature dependence (orange lines) is at odds with a normal Andreev bound state that follows a $1/T$ dependence. The small energy scale of the exponential may result from the reduced superconducting gap on the side surfaces. While the rather small width at zero temperature is consistent with a topologically protected 1D mode.}}{29}{figure.3.3}%

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.4}{\ignorespaces a) Soft-point contact on a bulk crystal of FeSe normalized to the critical temperature. b) Differential conductance using a planar junction, revealing a similar zero-bias peak. The smaller height results from the normal resistance of the Bi$_{2}$Te$_{2}$Se$_{1}$ that is in series with the tunnel contact. c) Differential resistance versus scaled voltage (blue) plotted along with the resistance versus temperature curve(orange). The strong overshoot of the voltage-dependent resistance and its return at high-bias to the normal state resistance confirms the spectra and zero bias conductance peak are not a result of heating.}}{31}{figure.3.4}%
